## Data Dashboard for KPI Analysis ðŸ“Š

### Overview
The **Data Dashboard for KPI Analysis** is an Excel-based solution designed to provide clear, concise, and visual insights into project performance and key metrics. It leverages Excelâ€™s data visualization tools to track and display project timelines, budget utilization, task progress, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Objectives:
- **Create an easy-to-use Excel dashboard** for visualizing KPIs.
- **Track project progress, budget, and task completion** effectively.
- **Provide stakeholders with a quick, visual summary** of performance metrics.

### Features:
#### Interactive Excel Dashboard:
A single Excel file containing various KPI charts.

- **Gantt Chart**: Tracks project phases and timelines visually.
- **Budget Chart**: Compares planned and actual expenditures using bar/line charts.
- **Task Completion Pie Chart**: Visual representation of completed, ongoing, and pending tasks.
- **Summary Table**: Key performance metrics summarized for quick insights.

### Tools Used:
- **Microsoft Excel**: The primary tool used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Excel Functions**: SUM, IF, VLOOKUP, and INDEX-MATCH functions for data manipulation.
- **Charts**: Gantt chart, bar chart, line chart, and pie chart for visualization.

### Visualizations
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

- **Gantt Chart**: Displays the project schedule, including start and end dates for each phase.
- **Budget Analysis Chart**: Shows budgeted vs. actual spending over time.
- **Task Completion Pie Chart**: Illustrates the percentage of tasks completed, in progress, or not started.

### Usage:
#### To use the Excel dashboard:
1. **Open the Excel File**: Double-click the `KPI_Dashboard.xlsx` file to open it in Excel.
2. **Data Entry**: Update the raw data tables with your current project information:
   - **Timeline Data**: Add project tasks, start dates, and end dates for the Gantt chart.
   - **Budget Data**: Enter planned and actual expenses in the budget sheet.
   - **Task Data**: Update task statuses (Completed, In Progress, On Hold) in the task sheet.
3. **View the Dashboard**: Navigate to the Dashboard tab to see the updated visualizations.
